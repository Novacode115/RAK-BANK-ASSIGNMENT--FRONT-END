# RAK-BANK-ASSIGNMENT-FRONT-END

## DESCRIPTION

This repository contains the frontend application for the RAK Bank assignment. It is built using React and provides the user interface for managing accounts. The form state management and authentication utilize a centralized store approach, resulting in a more organized, maintainable, and scalable application architecture. This aligns with best practices in Redux and state management. This project also includes test cases that mock the register and login pages, ensuring proper functionality and validation of user authentication processes.
